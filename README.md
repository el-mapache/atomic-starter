## Atomic Starter

Super simple `create-react-app`-powered template to make it easier to bootstrap a react app with tailwind and styled components.

### Bonus features

* Files are renamed to use lower-case. I know it doesn't make a difference (on an OS that is case insentitive anyway....), but I like it more.

* There is a script entitled `build:style` that will take your tailwind configs, css / sass and glob them together into a single file. Unminified, for dev purposes only.
